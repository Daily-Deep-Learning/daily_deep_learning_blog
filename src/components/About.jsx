        {/* Introduction */}
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-center mb-4">
          Welcome to my learning journey! Iâ€™m passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI. Through my journey, I aim to continuously learn, apply, and share knowledge with the community.
        </p>

        {/* Learning Path */}
        <div className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 space-y-6">
          <p>
            Starting from the basics of statistics and Python programming, I gradually immersed myself in the world of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and advanced AI techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in learning by doing, so most of my learning happens through hands-on projects where I build real-world applications, explore data, and train models. Through every project, I uncover new insights and refine my understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The journey is never-ending, and my goal is to contribute to the data science community by sharing what I learn through blogs, tutorials, and open-source projects.
          </p>
